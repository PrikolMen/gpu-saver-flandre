# GPU Saver - Flandre
Quite simple and optimized game rendering stop screen, when the game loses focus the game renderer is turned off and only this nice animation is rendered on the screen, picture size and background color can be set manually using console variables.
 
### ConVars:
- `cl_flandre_color` ( def. "0.15 0.15 0.15" ) - Background color of standby screen.
- `cl_flandre_size` ( def. 25 ) [1-100] - Size of standby screen icon.
